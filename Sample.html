Overview
=========================================
### <font size = "+4">**`r str_to_title(Lake_Name[1])`** </font size> 
<font size = "+3"> **STN `r Annual_TP_Specific$STN[1]`** </font size>

This is an overview of the Lake Health Report provided by the Lake Partner Program.
The Lake Partner Program (LPP) is a volunteer-based, inland lake water quality monitoring program in Ontario. The LPP enables lake stewards to monitor total phosphorus, calcium, chloride, and water clarity. `r str_to_title(Lake_Name[1])` has been apart of the Lake Partner Program from `r min(Year_Character_TP)` to `r max(Year_Character_TP)`. Precise, low-level total phosphorus data have been collected since 2002, and calcium and chloride concentrations were added in 2008 and 2015, respectively.
<br><br>
Sampling in the Lake Partner Program begins approximately 2-weeks after ice-off on any given lake. Lakes located on the the Precambrian Shield (90% of lakes in LPP) get sampled for total phosphorus, calcium, and chloride once per year, approximately 2-weeks after ice-off. Secchi disk samples occur monthly throughout the entire sampling season (May-October). For lakes that are not located on the Precambrian shield sampling in all forms occurs monthly throughout the sampling season. For information on why we sample ON and OFF Shield lakes differently refer to the total phosphorus section. 
<br><br> 
The mission of the Lake Partner Program is to foster interest & promote stewardship of water quality across Ontario & maintain a long-term database of water quality for Ontarioâ€™s inland lakes. The objectives include but are not limited to tracking long-term trends in total phosphorus and water clarity, and in more recent years, calcium and chloride, reporting and utilizing the water quality data collected, identifying emerging water quality issues in Ontario's inland lakes, maintaining a water quality database, and working in cooperation with volunteers and partners.

### History of the Lake Partner Program

The Lake Partner Program (LPP) began in 1996. The program evolved from the Ministryâ€™s Self Help Program, which collected information on chlorophyll and water since the early 1970s. In 2002, the LPP relocated from Toronto to the Dorset Environmental Science Centre, where low-level total phosphorus analyses were completed. The program continued to grow throughout the 2000s as the number of volunteers increased. 
<br>
The Lake Partner Program has partnered with the Federation of Ontario Cottagerâ€™s Associations (FOCA) since the start of the program in 1996. Through this partnership, FOCA provides outreach and stewardship to Ontarioâ€™s lakefront communities and distributes water quality information to the public through their website, presentations, and email communications.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
### Federation of Ontario Cottagers' Associations

The Federation of Ontario Cottagersâ€™ Associations (FOCA) is a not-for-profit membership organization that has been the voice of the Ontario waterfront since 1963. Today, FOCA has over 525 lake, road and residentsâ€™ association members, representing 50,000 waterfront property owning families across the province. FOCAâ€™s Lake Stewards are the backbone of the Lake Partner Program, the hundreds of volunteer water quality monitors who collect the annual water samples and secchi depth readings that make up the LPP dataset.

### Purpose of the Lake Health Report

This report provides background information on Ontarioâ€™s Lake Partner Program and summarizes each of the four water quality indicators monitored as part of the program (total phosphorus, calcium, chloride, and water clarity). This report is was created for `r str_to_title(Lake_Name[1])`'s Lake Partner Volunteers using the data they collected. 



***<font size="-1"> The LPP measures water quality in inland lakes across Ontario. The data is collected through volunteer monitoring efforts - citizen science. You can download the data set used in this analysis by visiting the Ontario Open Data Catalog at data.ontario.ca/dataset/ontario-lake-partner </font>***

Total Phosphorus
========================================
### **<font size = "+3"> What is total phosphorus? </font>** {.totalp}
Phosphorus is an essential element for aquatic systems and the organisms that inhabit them. Phosphorus is one of the factors that control growth of algae in most Ontario lakes. Increases in lake phosphorus concentrations may enhance algal growth, resulting in decreased water clarity, reduced deep-water oxygen concentrations, and, in extreme cases, cause algal blooms that may produce toxins, affect the aesthetics of the lake, and/or cause taste and odor problems in the water.
<br><br>
In the LPP, we measure *total phosphorus* (TP) concentrations, which is an indication of all of the phosphorus in a water sample. Lakes can be placed in three broad categories with respect to nutrients such as TP. Lakes with less than 10 Âµg/L are considered oligotrophic. These dilute, unproductive lakes rarely experience algal blooms. Lakes with TP between 10 and 20 Âµg/L are termed mesotrophic and are in the middle with respect to trophic status. These lakes show a susceptible to moderate algal blooms at concentrations near 20 Âµg/L. Lakes over 20 Âµg/L are classes as eutrophic and may exhibit persistent, nuisance and algal blooms.
<br><br>
Geographically, `r str_to_title(Lake_Name[1])` is located off the Precambrian Shield in Ontario. In the LPP, these "off-Shield" lakes are sampled monthly because they are more likely to show seasonal variability in TP concentrations. Many of the complex seasonal processes in these lakes would be difficult to assess without the data that volunteers collect on a monthly basis.

### Take aways from `r str_to_title(Lake_Name[1])`'s annual total phosphorus: {.takeawayfig4}

- This lake is a `r if(between((mean(Annual_TP_Specific$TP)), 0, 9.99) == TRUE) {"oligotrophic"}` `r if(between((mean(Annual_TP_Specific$TP)), 10.00, 19.99) == TRUE) {"mesotrophic"}``r if(between((mean(Annual_TP_Specific$TP)), 20, 100) == TRUE) {"eutrophic"}` lake. The trophic status refers to the overall biological productivity of the lake. `r if(between((mean(Annual_TP_Specific$TP)), 0, 9.99) == TRUE) {"Oligotrophic lake biological activity is relativley low and total phopshorus concentrations range from 0-10 Âµg/L."}``r if(between((mean(Annual_TP_Specific$TP)), 10.00, 19.99) == TRUE) {"Mesotrophic lakes have TP concentrations between 10-20 Âµg/L and have a moderate amount of biological productivity."}``r if(between((mean(Annual_TP_Specific$TP)), 20, 100) == TRUE) {"Eutrophic lakes have TP concentrations between 20-30 Âµg/L and have high concentrations of biological productivity and likely have high amounts of algae growth."}`

- Annually the phosphorus in `r str_to_title(Lake_Name[1])` had `r if(between(R_value_TP, -100, -0.1) == TRUE) {"fallen by"}` `r if(between(R_value_TP, 0.1, 100) == TRUE) {"risen by"}` `r if(between(R_value_TP, -0.1, 0.1) == TRUE) {"stayed relatively the same throughout its time in the LPP with an R value of"}` `r R_value_TP` Âµg/L.  

- `r str_to_title(Lake_Name[1])` has some variability in total phosphorus concentrations from year-to-year. For example TP concentrations have ranged from `r min(Annual_TP_Specific$TP)` Âµg/L in `r Min_Year_TP[1]` to `r max(Annual_TP_Specific$TP)` (Âµg/L) in `r Max_Year_TP[1]` since testing began in `r min(Year_Character_TP)`. Due to the number of years of data for `r str_to_title(Lake_Name[1])`, we can assume this variability is representative of normal conditions for this lake.

Calcium
=========================================
### <font size = "+3"> **What is calcium?** </font>

Many aquatic animals are sensitive to changes in calcium, such as mollusks, clams, amphipods, and crayfish. For example, tiny organisms called Daphnia, a primary food for many fish, are susceptible to decreasing calcium levels. DESC partner laboratory experiments have shown that the reproduction of most Daphnia species is jeopardized at lake calcium concentrations below 1.5 mg/L. In nature, where organisms must cope with multiple stressors, such as warmer temperatures expected with climate change, this threshold for calcium concentration is expected to be higher.
<br>
Under natural conditions (i.e., without human influence), calcium concentrations in soils are based on inputs from mineral weathering of rocks and atmospheric deposition, and losses through uptake by growing forests, and leaching to lakes and rivers. Calcium concentrations in Canadian Shield lakes have decreased over the last 35 years. Decades of acid rain, combined with deforestation, have depleted watershed stores of Calcium. Further declines are expected in many lakes. As a result, the LPP began monitoring calcium concentrations in 2008, to observe trends and identify lakes that may be sensitive to calcium decline.

Chloride
==============================================
### <font size = "+3"> **What is chloride?** </font>
Chloride concentrations have risen in recent years in Ontario lakes located near roads. The increasing levels are due to road salt application for winter road maintenance and the use of dust suppressants at other times of the year. Aquatic organisms, in particular some types of zooplankton, are particularly sensitive to chloride, and the impacts may be amplified by other stresses, such as calcium decline.
<br>
Typically for freshwater lakes a chloride level less than 120 mg/L is considered ideal for aquatic health (CCME, 2011). But research has been conducted showing chloride levels well below 120 mg/L can have negative effects on organisms in freshwater lakes, specifically low nutirent, low calcium lakes (Yao et al, (2020)).

Water Clarity
=============================================
### **<font size = "+3"> What is Secchi Depth?** </font>
LPP volunteers track the water clarity of their lake using a piece of equipment called a Secchi disk. In Ontario, Secchi depth is directly related to the depth at which light can penetrate the lake. Light penetration into the lake can be controlled by dissolved organic carbon (DOC), biological turbidity (e.g. algae) and non-biological turbidity, which can influence the colour of the lake.
<br>
Water clarity readings with a Secchi disk are valuable for tracking lake changes that would not be observed by monitoring TP concentrations on their own. Such as the impacts of invasive species (e.g. zebra mussels), climate change effects, or watershed disturbances. Long-term trends in water clarity are also significant because they are directly linked to the value of property in Ontario.

>**Figure 10.** Histogram showing the distribution of secchi depths for all off-Shield lakes in the LPP from `r min(Year_Character_Sec)` to `r max(Year_Character_Sec)`. The dash and dot line represents `r str_to_title(Lake_Name[1])` average secchi depths. Only secchi depths taken in June, July, and August due to research showing these are the most stable months for secchi depth readings.

### Highlights from `r str_to_title(Lake_Name[1])`'s comparison to other off-Shield lakes: {.takeawayfig10}

-	The average secchi depths between `r min(Year_Character_Sec)` and `r max(Year_Character_Sec)` is `r mean(Annual_Sec_Specific$Secchi)` m.

- `r str_to_title(Lake_Name[1])` falls into the `r Percentile_only_Sec`th percentile of secchi levels in off-shield lakes. Meaning `r str_to_title(Lake_Name[1])` is `r if(between(Specific_Percentile_Sec$percentile, 0, 50) == TRUE) {"in the lower 50% of On-Shield lakes in the LPP, regarding secchi depth."}` `r if(between(Specific_Percentile_Sec$percentile, 51, 100) == TRUE) {"in the upper 50% of On-Shield lakes in the LPP, regarding secchi levels."}`

### Highlights from `r str_to_title(Lake_Name[1])`'s annual water clarity levels: {.takeawayfig11}

- Annually the water clarity in `r str_to_title(Lake_Name[1])` has `r if(between(R_value_Sec, -100, -0.01) == TRUE) {"decreased by"}` `r if(between(R_value_Sec, 0.01, 100) == TRUE) {"increased by"}` `r if(between(R_value_Sec, -0.1, 0.1) == TRUE) {"stayed relatively the same at"}` `r R_value_Sec` m annually. 

- `r str_to_title(Lake_Name[1])` has some variability in water clarity levels from year-to-year. For example water clarity has ranged from `r min(Annual_Sec_Specific$Secchi)` m in `r Min_Year_Sec[5]` to `r max(Annual_Sec_Specific$Secchi)` m in `r Max_Year_Sec[5]` since testing began in `r min(Year_Character_Sec)`. Due to the number of years of data for `r str_to_title(Lake_Name[1])`, we can assume this variability is representative of normal conditions for this lake.
